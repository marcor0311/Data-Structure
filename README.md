# Data-Structure
## Course Overview

This course was focused in applying linear, hierarchical and generar-purpose data structures to solve multiple types of media problems involving memory and disk operations. The primary objectives included:

- Implement solutions using the various data structures learned
- Elaborate detailed designs of solutions based on structures of data that allow you to solve real-life problems
- Determine good programming practices for the implementation of data structures.
- Explain different data structures (linear, hierarchical, general) with the aim of solving median problems complexity in implementation and design.
- Elaborate alternative data structures that allow the resolution of problems more effectively, making hybrids of them with the aim of creating more robust solutions

## Implementation

It's important to note that all course concepts and examples were practically implemented using C
